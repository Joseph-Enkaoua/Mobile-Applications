Running this project requeires an active Firebase project lined to this app. I uploaded all files with the Firebase keys as they're meant to be shared with the user wihtout any security concern but those will be deactivated soon. You can create a free tier project in Firebase and follow the instructions to link it to this cloned repository in order to make it work.
