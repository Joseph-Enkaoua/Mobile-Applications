# 🌤️ Weather App

Welcome to my Weather applicaion where you can fetch the forecast in your current location using your device GPS sensor or search any city or region to display the current, daily and weekly weather.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project I use [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API to fetch weather data.

Possible errors are handled - no connection or location not found included.

The app is made responsive to fit all kind of mobile devices: Iphones and Ipads in all sizes. In theory it should work the same on Android devices but I tested the app on Apple devices only.
